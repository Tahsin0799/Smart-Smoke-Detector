# Smart-Smoke-Detector

This project was done using ONLY 74 series ICs. THE ARDUINO UNO HAS BEEN USED FOR 5V DC SUPPLY ONLY, NO CODING WAS DONE IN THIS PROJECT. IT'S A TOTALLY MICRO-CONTROLLER FREE PROJECT.  Here, the smoke sensor MQ135 was used and then we converted the analog output from the sensor to digital in range between 000 to 101 ie from 0-5 scale smoke concentration has been detected by our project.   Here,smoke sensor output greater than or equal to 3.85V has been set as the maximum smoke density detector(101 output in ADC) and a series combination of 1K resistors has been used for adc purpose afterwards.   In comparator block, as smoke sensor value goes above the threshold value that can be set manually, the alarm will start ringing and stops right after 7 seconds.
